 Religion, Gender, and Culture

  DISSERTATION TOPIC
The relationship between Christianity and the body, particularly women’s bodies, has never been what we might call healthy. While the nature of this relationship has evolved over time, one thing has stayed relatively constant - the body is a powerful barometer, especially for women, of sin and salvation.</description>

      <description>As an educator, I am invested in developing dynamic classrooms utilizing creative pedagogy that inspires student engagement. I approach each class as an opportunity to explore the study of religion with students as they learn to apply new concepts to their own experiences and develop methods of understanding and empathizing with the experiences of others. I also make every effort to bring a feminist perspective to the material I teach; I believe one of the most important things I can do as an educator is foreground an intersectional feminist perspective.</description>
