My teaching is informed by my belief that education is ultimately a collaborative enterprise that is best pursued through pedagogies that engage every student in the learning process. As an educator, I am invested in developing dynamic classrooms utilizing creative pedagogy that inspires student engagement. I view each class as an opportunity to generate a learning community where students, working together, are inspired to take ownership of the assigned materials and class topics.

In order to ground students in class material, I often begin class with some lecture style teaching–often
utilizing digital media resources. These “mini-lectures” are meant to provide context as well as distillation
of key ideas from the assigned texts. When teaching on Islamic veiling practices in “Religions in America
Today,” for example, I utilize PowerPoint and Prezi presentations I have developed to supply students
with the necessary visual supplementations for a topic as material and sensory as veiling is. After working
with students to form a solid foundation, I encourage them to work either as small groups or as a large
group to explore what they are learning in new and synergetic ways. This approach also allows me to
gauge students’ levels of comprehension of the texts and materials based on what develops during
discussion. As a result, my class time tends to be flexibly structured to allow me to focus on topics from
the assigned materials that students find relevant, challenging, or confusing.

While teaching a course cross-listed in both religious studies and communication studies entitled “Digital Media and Religion,” I encourage active learning by facilitating activities that prompt students to get up, move, and collaboratively create something together. For example, when we discuss the role of the typewriter in early digital technology, I have students divide into small groups and type discussion questions and responses to each other on an actual typewriter. I also consistently make use of the white board asking students to work together to visualize class topics in new ways through the construction of timelines, Venn diagrams, and outlines. Many times, by the end of our class meeting, students have been inspired to take photos of their work so that they could carry the ideas and connections they have developed with them–often utilizing the photos again to write their papers and prepare for their exams.

In recognition of my success in teaching at The University of Iowa, I received the Rev. Louis P.
Penningroth Award for excellence in teaching and mentoring in 2018. My effectiveness in the classroom
is also attested to by my course evaluations over the last eight semesters. Statistically, I am consistently
rated above average both in terms of religious studies instructors as well as instructors in the college of
liberal arts and sciences more broadly. One student from my “Digital Media and Religion” course
commented: “This has been my favorite class so far! Each class we are presented with new ideas and
ways in which to view the world. I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to both the instructor and my
classmates’ ideas on the topics covered in class.”

By employing a wide range of teaching styles and tools, I approach both teaching and learning in a
multifaceted way. My approach is intended to encourage growth and development in students by
presenting and responding to a variety of learning styles while promoting a deeper comprehension of
class topics.
