<h4>Embodied Secularism: Protestant Secularism, Bodies, and American Weight Loss Culture</h4>

<p>While calorie counting seems an utterly secular and mundane practice in the United States, body
management has historically been a weighty matter with moral consequences. According to
biblical mythology, humanity’s fall from grace was precipitated by a woman eating, after all. By
analyzing the nature of “the secular” and “the religious” through the lens of body management,
this study considers how women’s practices of weight management have become cultural
techniques for producing and replicating protestant secularism. </p>

<p>Protestant secularism denotes a consolidated, pervasive protestant ideology, defined by
individualism, self-control, voluntarism, and the primacy of textuality that continues to inform
American secularism today. Arguing that there was nothing inevitable or natural about the
consolidation of protestant ideology into the American religio-political landscape, scholars like
Tracy Fessenden, Winnifred Sullivan, Janet Jakobsen, and Ann Pellegrini analyze the ways in
which protestantism has informed American secularism, both historically and today. This
hegemonic protestant entrenchment appears, for example, in the nurturing of American citizensubjects
in early tax-supported public school systems, in legal definitions of religion that protect
mainstream institutionalized protestantism without protecting the variable lived religious
practices of non-protestants, and in how the dominant model of secularism, tied to marketreformed
protestantism, represents a hegemonic political project that seeks to export its form of
market rationality elsewhere. While previous scholarship in this area tends to analyze American
secularism on the scale of populations, this project shifts the primary unit of analysis from
populations to the individual and how the individual negotiates, embodies, and mediates “the
secular” and “the religious” by participating in American weight loss cultures.</p>

<p>When women participate in weight loss cultures they enact and embody “the secular” and “the
religious” on the scale of the everyday. This study demonstrates how bodies act as materialdiscursive
sites mediating perceived tensions between “religion” and “secularism” through
bodily techniques of weight loss. New materialist theory and affect theory productively intersect
at the site of the body and inform this project’s approach to American weight loss cultures as
entanglements of agential affective forces, space, bodies, and other matter(s) congealing at the
site of bodies performing the techniques prescribed by these very weight loss cultures. </p>

<p>This project maps this entanglement from 1800 through 2015 coalescing around three specific
moments. First it considers early nineteenth century American weight watchers like Sylvester
Graham and his followers, who represent the first iteration of an American weight loss public.
This first case study profiles one of the earliest American dieting cultures–the water cure–which
often supplemented grahamite convictions in its practitioners. Most hydropathic spas were run
by women and functioned as epicenters of dress reform, temperance, and the women’s rights
movement. Through an analysis of this trend’s primary periodical Water-Cure
Journal (published between 1845 and 1857), this project traces changing attitudes toward the
body, particularly in light of the personal ads it ran that included height and weight specifications
for prospective partners. This analysis reveals shifting attitudes about the body as well as 
evolving orientations towards religion, spirituality, and the increasingly “secular” imperative to
count calories.
</p>

<p>Second, this project analyzes twentieth century devotional fitness cultures, appearing as part of
the modern evangelical Christian lifestyle industry, to highlight how these contemporary weight
loss movements re-imagine themselves in light of the seemingly secular weight loss trends of the
mid-twentieth century. This second case study analyzes two specific movements–The
Weigh Down Diet and The Daniel Plan. Because these two movements appeared at two slightly
different moments in the evolution of modern faith-based weight loss culture, this project offers
a comparison to reveal shifting themes and commitments in devotional diet cultures that mirror
similar developments in non-devotional diet cultures. This mirroring is not the result of one trend
mimicking the other but is rather the result of shared origins in protestant secular bodily
techniques. </p>

<p>Finally, this project explores a contemporary iteration of American weight loss–the proana
movement, which emerged alongside the rise of digital technology and widespread internet
usage in the late twentieth century. Pro-ana is an online community that rejects treatment-based
approaches to eating disorders and often utilizes religious concepts and categories to define
and frame its members’ devotion to weight loss. Through an analysis of interactions and posted
material collected from online pro-ana forums and sites, this project explores how the proana
movement disrupts delineations between “online” and “offline” space, between “religion”
and “media” and challenges how “religion” and “secularism” are defined in the twenty-first
century. Indeed, the bodily techniques of the pro-ana movement highlight the continued and
persistent entanglements of “secularism” and “religion” at the site of the body.</p>

<p>By offering interpretative accounts of three key moments in American dieting history, this
dissertation contributes to ongoing conversations in religious studies, cultural studies, and
histories of weight loss in the United States by highlighting how protestantism and secularism
are not simply concepts but also embodied practices. First, this analysis highlights
that protestantism and secularism are as embodied as they are textual and thus corrects a
longstanding disregard for the bodily techniques that sustain public culture in the United
States. Second, by mobilizing new materialisms and affect theory, this project offers a robust
account of the gendered body in contemporary dieting culture and how these dieting bodies
contribute to the creation of broader political formations. Finally, this project contributes to the
growing body of literature that addresses the history and evolution of American weight loss
culture and diet reform by offering a fresh interpretation of three key moments in that history that
highlight shifting trends in protestant secularism in the United States more broadly. Ultimately,
this project explores how body management itself–regardless of whether or not it is framed as
religious or secular–is both the product of protestant secular entanglements as well as the means
for their replication.</p>
