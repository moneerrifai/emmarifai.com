<p>Like religion, secularism is something negotiated, embodied, and mediated, and while it is often
perceived and analyzed on the scale of populations, when women participate in weight loss
cultures they enact and embody “the secular” on the scale of the everyday. While calorie
counting seems an utterly secular and mundane practice in the United States, body management
has historically been a weighty matter with moral consequences. According to biblical
mythology, humanity’s fall from grace was precipitated by a woman eating after all. By
considering the nature of “the secular” and “the religious” through the lens of body management,
my dissertation project argues that women’s weight loss practices have become cultural
techniques for producing and replicating America’s particular protestant-informed secularism.</p>

<p>By offering interpretive accounts of three key moments in American dieting history, my
dissertation demonstrates how bodies act as material-discursive sites mediating perceived
tensions between “religion” and “secularism” through bodily techniques of weight loss.
Techniques of protestant secularism are not only performed and replicated at the site of
populations and publics but also through the daily, even mundane, practices of individuals
performing “secularism” through the various bodily techniques they engage with. New
materialist theory and affect theory productively intersect at the site of the body and inform my
project’s approach to American weight loss cultures as entanglements of agential affective
forces, space, bodies, and other matter(s) congealing at the site of bodies performing the
techniques prescribed by these very weight loss cultures.</p>

<p>My dissertation maps this entanglement from 1800 through 2015 coalescing around three specific moments in the form of detailed case studies. The first case study profiles one of the earliest American dieting cultures–the water cure. Through an analysis of this trend’s primary periodical Water-Cure Journal (published between 1845 and 1857), I trace changing attitudes toward the body, particularly in light of the personal ads it ran that included height and weight specifications for prospective partners. This analysis reveals shifting attitudes about the body as well as evolving orientations towards religion, spirituality, and the increasingly “secular” imperative to count calories. My second case study analyzes two specific religious weight loss movements–The Weigh Down Diet and The Daniel Plan, which emerged toward the end of the twentieth century alongside the modern evangelical Christian lifestyle industry. Because these two movements appeared at two slightly different moments in the evolution of modern faith-based weight loss culture, I offer a comparison to reveal shifting themes and commitments in devotional diet cultures that mirror similar developments in non-devotional diet cultures. This mirroring is not the result of one trend mimicking the other but is rather the result of shared origins in protestant secular bodily techniques. My final case study explores a contemporary iteration of American weight loss–the pro-ana movement, which emerged alongside the rise of digital technology and widespread internet usage at the turn of the twenty-first century. Through an analysis of interactions and posted material collected from online pro-ana forums and sites, I explore how the pro-ana movement disrupts delineations between “online” and “offline” space, between “religion” and “media” and challenges how we define “religion” and “secularism” in the twenty-first century. Indeed, the bodily techniques of the pro-ana movement highlight the continued and persistent entanglements of “secularism” and “religion” at the site of the body.</p>

<p>This project makes contributions to three bodies of scholarly literature: religious studies, cultural
studies, and histories of American dieting cultures. First, my analysis highlights
that protestantism and secularism are as embodied as they are textual and thus corrects a
longstanding disregard for the bodily techniques that sustain public culture in the United
States. Second, by mobilizing new materialisms and affect theory, I offer a robust account of the
gendered body in contemporary dieting culture and how these dieting bodies contribute to the
creation of broader political formations. Finally, my work contributes to the growing body of
literature that addresses the history and evolution of American weight loss culture and diet
reform, which I supplement by offering a fresh interpretation of three key moments in that
history that highlight shifting trends in protestant secularism in the United States more
broadly. Ultimately, my project explores how body management itself–regardless of whether or
not it is framed as religious or secular–is both the product of protestant secular entanglements as
well as the means for their replication.</p>

<p>Tangentially, I collaborated on a paper, “Spreading the Religion of Thinness from California to
Calcutta: A Critical Feminist Postcolonial Analysis” which appeared in the Spring 2009 issue of
the Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion. In this paper, we engaged with a critical feminist
postcolonial analysis to explore the neocolonial dynamics and effects of the spread of white-
Western female body norms to women in the two-thirds world. Drawing on research about the
growing influence of the Euro-American idealization of thinness on women in the global South,
we analyzed the missionary-colonizing aspects of the globalization of American culture’s
devotion to “feminine” thinness, highlighting its commercial underpinnings, implicitly racist
subtext, and deleterious effects on the mental, physical, and spiritual well-being of women in
postcolonial contexts. Ultimately, we argued that the globalization of the Hollywood ideal of
female slenderness to women in the Southern Hemisphere illustrates the extent to which
women’s bodies continue to function as primary sites of contact, conflict, and colonization in the
process of Western expansion.</p>

<p>I am currently working on an article for Religion Compass on religion, secularism, and weight
loss culture in America, which offers a summary of the state of the field for non-specialists. I am
also working on a journal article for the Journal of Religion, Media, and Digital Culture that is
extension of the work I presented at the 2018 International Society for Media, Religion, and
Culture conference in Boulder. This project, entitled “Networked Anorexia: Pro-Ana
Communities, Network Logic, and the Internet,” explores how pro-ana adherents literally rely on
technology that is networked in order to generate communities that are then built on network
logic. Additionally, I have a forthcoming review of Pamela Klassen’s The Story of Radio Mind:
A Missionary’s Journey on Indigenous Land and a previously published review of Donovan
Schaefer’s Religious Affects: Animality, Evolution, and Power in Material Religion: The
Journal of Objects, Art and Belief.</p>

<p>Overall, my work is an interdisciplinary engagement with broader themes concerning
protestantism and secularism in America; critical theory and religion; religion, food, and the
body; and gender, religion, and culture. I am committed to exploring how gender, religion, and
secularism intersect in mundane, everyday practices at the site of women’s bodies. This
commitment offers an important contribution to the fields of religious studies, cultural studies,
and gender studies by shifting the primary unit of analysis from populations to the individual and
how the individual body negotiates, embodies, and mediates “the secular” and “the religious”
through daily actions and behaviors.</p>
