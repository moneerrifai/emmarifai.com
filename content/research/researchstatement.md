DISSERTATION TOPIC

The relationship between Christianity and the body, particularly women’s bodies, has never been what we might call healthy.  While the nature of this relationship has evolved over time, one thing has stayed relatively constant - the body is a powerful barometer, especially for women, of sin and salvation.  Despite the seeming secularization of western society, the bond between the body and the church remains strong today.  Historians like Hillel Schwartz, Joan Jacobs Brumberg, and Amy Erdman Farrell have tended to emphasize the secularization of American weight loss culture over time while scholars in religious studies, particular Marie Griffith, Michelle Lelwica, and Lynne Gerber, have examined more modern relationships among faith, gender, and weight loss.  However, very little research has been done addressing the ways in which Protestant values and ideas not only catalyzed weight loss culture in the United States but also how American weight loss culture is still - implicitly and explicitly - entrenched in faith-based systems of meaning. 


My work demonstrates how the modern obsession with body size did not originate as a secular concept.  While Protestant women are ground zero for the modern obsession with the thin body, they are not the only women who experience pressure to conform to the thin ideal of today’s culture.  Exploring religion and weight loss culture reveals how women’s troubled relationships with food and their bodies in today’s “secular” society have roots in America’s not-so-distant Protestant past.  Indeed, it is the ongoing American Protestant present that continues to provide a milieu that foments concerning connections between a woman’s body size and her worth.  


I employ Max Weber’s “Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism” hypothesis to better understand the influence of certain Protestant beliefs, ideas, and values on contemporary American women’s manic attempts to control and reduce their bodies.  This analysis illuminates how the female body became the site of women’s “worldly asceticism” - the place where they work out their sense of vocation or “calling” - the primary indicator of their “salvation.”  I find that while the obsession with body size appears secular today, the relationship between size and virtue did not simply go away.  Rather it has found new expression in a culture and economy that has been radically transformed, in part, by the Protestant Ethic itself.  By analyzing American dieting trends, cookbooks, and popular prescriptive literature, I explore how the seemingly secular enterprise of reducing one’s weight has come to function very much like a religion for many American women.  By understanding the Protestant origins of these harmful ideas, we can develop more comprehensive ways of combating the pervasive self-loathing many women feel toward their bodies.


CURRENT PROJECTS

I am currently editing my Master’s thesis “Fashioning Identities:  New Relationships with Fashion and Modesty in Turkey” for publication. The updated version of this paper is entitled “Disrupting Secular Space:  Veiled Female Bodies in Turkish Shopping Malls.”  In this paper I consider the assemblages that arise when veiled female bodies enter the secular shopping spaces of urban Turkey.  On September 18, 2014, Hurriyet Daily News reported that Lady Gaga had been spotted shopping in Nisantasi, one of the poshest - and most secular - neighborhoods in Istanbul, sporting a hijab and long coat.  By decentering intention, we can see how the headscarf on the non-Muslim head of Lady Gaga is as “disruptive” to secular space as those worn by Muslim women all over Turkey.  Utilizing new materialist theories, I argue that the headscarf itself - on a body coded as female - is a powerful actant that both disrupts the codification of shopping space in Turkey as secular while also shaping the identities and experiences of the women who wear them in these spaces.


I am also developing a second piece for publication that traces linkages between Protestantism and microcredit lending in the global south.  In 2006, the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank the Peace Prize, lauding that “micro-credit has proved to be an important liberating force” for women.  It is noteworthy, then, that, unlike their secular equivalents, Christian MFIs overwhelmingly provide loans to men.  Additionally, recent studies suggest that Protestant-affiliated MFIs not only outperform their Catholic-affiliated counterparts but sometimes their secular counterparts as well.  Taken together, we see evidence of Max Weber’s Protestant Ethic hypothesis at work in the deployment of microloans in the global south.  This points to a continued usefulness of Weber’s thesis as a theoretical lens for considering modern capitalism in an increasingly globalized world.  Ultimately, microcredit is a convenient pedagogical tool that works to replicate modern capitalism in new populations.  Utilizing Weber’s hypothesis, I argue that both Protestant-affiliated MFIs as well as their secular counterparts utilize structures and models inspired by particular Protestant ideas and values.


PAST PROJECTS

In 2016, I published a review of Donovan Schaefer’s Religious Affects:  Animality, Evolution, and Power in Material Religion:  The Journal of Objects, Art and Belief.  Additionally, I collaborated on a paper, “Spreading the Religion of Thinness from California to Calcutta:  A Critical Feminist Postcolonial Analysis” which appeared in the Spring 2009 issue of the Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion.  In this paper, we engaged with a critical feminist postcolonial analysis to explore the neocolonial dynamics and effects of the spread of white-Western female body norms to women in the two-thirds world.  Drawing on research about the growing influence of the Euro-American idealization of thinness on women in the global South, we analyzed the missionary-colonizing aspects of the globalization of American culture’s devotion to “feminine” thinness, highlighting its commercial underpinnings, implicitly racist subtext, and deleterious effects on the mental, physical, and spiritual well-being of women in postcolonial contexts.  Ultimately, we argue that the globalization of the Hollywood ideal of female slenderness to women in the Southern Hemisphere illustrates the extent to which women’s bodies continue to function as primary sites of contact, conflict, and colonization in the process of Western expansion.
