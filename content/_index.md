<p> Greetings and welcome to my page!  I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Religious Studies at The University of Iowa.  My research and teaching interests include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Protestantism and Secularism in the United States</li>
  <li>Critical Theory and Religion</li>
  <li>Religion, Food, and the Body</li>
  <li>Gender, Religion, and Culture</li>
</ul>

<p>My dissertation, entitled “Embodying the Secular: Power, Bodies, and American Secularism,” argues that American secularism is best understood as fundamentally embodied and that this embodiment is made plain in contemporary techniques of body management. I find that the body is a foundational site where we can see the co-constitutive nature of the “secular” and the “religious” emerge as well as the scope and contours of their entangled ontologies. This entanglement is particularly clear when we consider how American secularism is imbued with the same Protestant values, including commitments to individualism, self-control, and optimization, that orient American cultural life more broadly. Through case studies on direct-to-consumer genetic testing, biohacking, and the pro-ana movement, I explore the tensions between the discourses and practices that seek to sustain American secularism and the bodies that confound these attempts by expanding and contracting the field of possibility from which the contemporary American subject emerges. Intervening in religious studies, cultural studies, and gender studies, this project demonstrates just how central embodiment is to the construction of American culture today.</p>
